  "description": "Focusing on the Museum of Arts and Crafts' Scientific Instruments Gallery, this collaborative puzzle game (4 players) aims to facilitate the understanding of objects by allowing players to use them virtually. The instruments, inanimate behind the windows are then made 'alive'. The game consists of 3 missions, each focusing on an object. The experiment ends with the manipulation of a tangible model located in the museum. Players are given access to an interactive map of scientific instruments outside the walls at the end of their experience.",
  "why": "Built during a six month period at Gobelins, l'Ecole de l'Image, from conception to coding, with a team of 4 people:  1 other developer: Arno Dubois and 2 designers: Chloélia Breton and Vincent Calas.",
