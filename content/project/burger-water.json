  "description": "Did you ever asked this question in your mind, how much water did it cost to have this burger in my plate ? Burger Water is a website designed to answer that question ! Threw a little experience where you create your own burger, you'll eventually find out how much water it needed !",
  "why": "Built during a week period on my Bachelor's degree at Gobelins, l'Ecole de l'Image, from conception to coding, with a designer: LÃ©a Morand. At first the experience was built with a canvas and a library to move ingredients. However, after a bit of trouvle with performance, I chose to use CSS only and translate everything on the page.",
