  "description": "Alexandra Douard is a student in communication, based in Paris. I worked with her to build her brand new portfolio showcasing her work.",
  "why": "Built in 2020, it's my first experience on a real project with ReactJS and Redux. It was also the first time for me to work with a real client and build a website for someone. We first discussed the design and content to finally create animations. There's no back-end, I used an internal JSON file with the content of each project she worked on.",
